Future Accomplishment as a Web design 

After my studies in this course, I look forward to:

- Build a website for my Sister growing business in Canada.
-Build a website for my Aunty bookshop back in Cameroon, Africa
- Build a website for my present company in Canada and make it very interactive to enable online payment can be done by customers.


In the Future, I will like to:
- Combine my knowledge on Cloud computing and web design to make  a difference in my life and the world.
-Study Java and advance my study in mobile app development.

Let wait and see what the future brings.

Thanks.
