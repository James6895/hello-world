Future Accomplishment as a Web design 

After my studies in this course, I look forward to:

- Build a website for my Sister growing business
-Build a website my Aunty bookshop back in Cameroon, Africa
- Build a website for my present company in Canada and make it very interactive so that online payment can be done


In the Future, I will like to

- Combine my knowledge on Cloud computing and web design to make  a difference
-Study Java and mobile app development
